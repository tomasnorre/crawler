Configuration records
=====================

Formerly configuration was done by using pageTS (see below). This is
still possible (fully backwards compatible) but not recommended.
Instead of writing pageTS simply create a configuration record (table:
``tx_crawler_configuration``) and put it on the topmost page of the
pagetree you want to affect with this configuration.

The fields in these records are related to the pageTS keys described
below.

Fields and their pageTS equivalents
===================================

General
-------

   Backend configuration record: General

Name
   Corresponds to the "key" part in the pageTS setup e.g.
   :typoscript:`tx_crawler.crawlerCfg.paramSets.myConfigurationKeyName`

Protocol for crawling
   Force HTTP, HTTPS or keep the configured protocol

Processing instruction filter
   List of processing instructions. See also:
   :ref:`paramSets.[key].procInstrFilter <crawler-tsconfig-paramSets-key-procInstrFilter>`

Base URL
   Set baseUrl (most likely the same as the entry point configured in your
   site configuration)

Pids only
   List of Page Ids to limit this configuration to. See also:
   :ref:`paramSets.[key].pidsOnly <crawler-tsconfig-paramSets-key-pidsOnly>`

Exclude pages
   Comma separated list of page ids which should not be crawled.
   You can do recursive exclusion by adding `uid`+`depth` e.g. 6+3,
   this will ensure that all pages including pageUid 6 and 3 levels down
   will not be crawled.

Configuration
   Parameter configuration. The values of GET variables are according to a
   special syntax. See also: :ref:`paramSets.[key]
   <crawler-tsconfig-paramSets-key>`

Processing instruction parameters
   Options for processing instructions. Will be defined in the respective third
   party modules. See also: :ref:`paramSets.[key].procInstrParams
   <crawler-tsconfig-paramSets-key-procInstrParams>`

Crawl with FE user groups
   User groups to set for the request. See also:
   :ref:`paramSets.[key].userGroups <crawler-tsconfig-paramSets-key-userGroups>` and the hint in :ref:`create-crawler-configuration`
