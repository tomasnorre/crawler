The TYPO3 Crawler is quite often used for generated the Index of Indexed Search.

Unfortunately we don't have any good documentation included on this, but you can help in two ways.

1. You can help write the documentations
2. You can tip into the money pool, to help sponsor those writing the documentation.

You can see the issue here: https://github.com/tomasnorre/crawler/issues/558
