Priority Crawling
=================

.. versionadded:: 9.1.0

Some website has a quite large number of pages. Some pages are logically more
important than others e.g. the start-, support-, product-, you name it-pages.
These important pages are also the pages where we want to have the best caching
and performance, as they will most likely be the pages with the most changes and
the most traffic.

With TYPO3 10 LTS the `sysext/seo` introduced among other things, the
`sitemap_priority`, which is used to generate an SEO optimised sitemap.xml
where page priorities are listed as well. Their priorities will most likely be higher the
more important the page is for you and the end-user.

This logic is something that we can benefit from in the Crawler as well. A
Website with let us say 10.000 pages, will have different importance depending on
the page you are at. Therefore we have changed the functionality of the crawler,
to take the value of this field, range from 0.0 to 1.0, into consideration when
processing the crawler queue. This means that if you have a page with high priority
for your sitemap, it will also be crawled first when a new crawler process is
added.

This ensures that we will always crawl the pages that have the highest importance to
you and your end-user based on your sitemap priority. We choose to
reuse this field, to not have editors doing work that is more or less similar twice.

If you don't want to use this functionality, it's ok. You can just ignore the
options that the `sysext/seo` gives you and all pages will by default get a priority
0.5, and therefore do not influence the processing order as everyone will have the
same priority.

TYPO3 9 LTS
-----------

In TYPO3 9 LTS, the will be a new tab :guilabel:`Crawler` when editing pages, here you

Disclaimer
----------
This `sitemap_priority` is not added to `typo3/cms-seo` before TYPO3 10LTS, so
it has been added to the :file:`EXT:crawler/ext_tables.sql`
to have it present already in TYPO3 9 LTS. The TCA for this field will only be
included from the crawler in TYPO3 9 LTS, otherwise defaulting to setup from
TYPO3 10 LTS or higher.

This field has thus the naming, no influence what so ever on the SEO optimization
of the website in TYPO3 9 LTS.

The decision to reuse the field was done to lower the migration effort when going
from TYPO3 9 LTS to 10 LTS or higher, as the field will need no migration at all.
